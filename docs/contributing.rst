I Have a Question
-----------------

If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the
available `Documentation <https://ziplign.readthedocs.io>`__.

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing
`Issues <https://github.com/martinghunt/ziplign/issues>`__ that might
help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need
clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also
advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need
clarification, we recommend the following:

-  Open an
   `Issue <https://github.com/martinghunt/ziplign/issues/new>`__.
-  Provide as much context as you can about what you‚Äôre running into.
-  Provide the Ziplign version and your OS (Windows, MacOS etc),
   depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

Reporting Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before Submitting a Bug Report
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A good bug report shouldn‚Äôt leave others needing to chase you up for
more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully,
collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report.
Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any
potential bug as fast as possible.

-  Make sure that you are using the latest version.
-  Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side
   e.g.¬†using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure
   that you have read the
   `documentation <https://ziplign.readthedocs.io>`__. If you are
   looking for support, you might want to check `this
   section <#i-have-a-question>`__).
-  To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already
   solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already
   a bug report existing for your bug or error in the `bug
   tracker <https://github.com/martinghunt/ziplign/issues?q=label%3Abug>`__.
-  Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to
   see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the
   issue.
-  Collect information about the bug:

   -  OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
   -  Version of Ziplign
   -  Possibly your input files and the output, or screenshots
   -  Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce
      it with older versions?

How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue
with the project:

-  Open an
   `Issue <https://github.com/martinghunt/ziplign/issues/new>`__. (Since
   we can‚Äôt be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you
   not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
-  Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
-  Please provide as much context as possible and describe the
   *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the
   issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug
   reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test
   case.
-  Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it‚Äôs filed:

-  The project team will label the issue accordingly.
-  A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided
   steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to
   reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark
   the issue as ``needs-repro``. Bugs with the ``needs-repro`` tag will
   not be addressed until they are reproduced.
-  If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked
   ``needs-fix``, as well as possibly other tags (such as ``critical``),
   and the issue will be left to be `implemented by
   someone <#code-contributions>`__.

Suggesting Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for
Ziplign, **including completely new features and minor improvements to
existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help
maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find
related suggestions.

.. raw:: html

   <!-- omit in toc -->

Before Submitting an Enhancement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Make sure that you are using the latest version.
-  Read the `documentation <https://ziplign.readthedocs.io>`__ carefully
   and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an
   individual configuration.
-  Perform a `search <https://github.com/martinghunt/ziplign/issues>`__
   to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add
   a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
-  Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the
   project. It‚Äôs up to you to make a strong case to convince the
   project‚Äôs developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that
   we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and
   not just a small subset. If you‚Äôre just targeting a minority of
   users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as `GitHub
issues <https://github.com/martinghunt/ziplign/issues>`__.

-  Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the
   suggestion.
-  Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement**
   in as many details as possible.
-  **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you
   expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell
   which alternatives do not work for you.
-  You may want to **include screenshots or screen recordings** which
   help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the
   suggestion is related to. You can use
   `LICEcap <https://www.cockos.com/licecap/>`__ to record GIFs on macOS
   and Windows, and the built-in `screen recorder in
   GNOME <https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/screen-shot-record.html.en>`__
   or `SimpleScreenRecorder <https://github.com/MaartenBaert/ssr>`__ on
   Linux.
-  **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Ziplign
   users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved
   it better and which could serve as inspiration.

Code Contributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ziplign is developed using the Godot engine and IDE available for free
from here: https://godotengine.org/download/. It is available for
Windows, MacOS and Linux. Please use the Godot IDE it to modify the
code, and let it do the formatting (indendation etc). Test your changes
using the ‚ÄúRun Project‚Äù button near the top right of the IDE.

Please test the main functionality of Ziplign using the built-in test
data. Run the project, select ‚ÄúNew‚Äù, click the test data button at the
top, and then ‚ÄúStart‚Äù. See the `test
data <https://ziplign.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#use-the-test-data>`__
documentation for more details and screenshots.

Once the test data are loaded, test all of the following still work,
which is a basic check of the main functionality. It does not test
everything.

1. All navigation buttons at the top left, and the cursor keys on the
   keyboard.
2. The main horizontal scroll bars at the top and bottom, to slide the
   genomes left and right.
3. Zooming using the buttons on the left and with the keys ``-``, ``+``,
   ``=``. Also, where possible, with a mouse wheel or trackpad pinch
   gesture.
4. Double-click on any BLAST match to check that the view jumps so that
   the match is on the left of the window. Reset the view by pressing
   ``=``.
5. Reverse complement buttons on the left. Check both the top and bottom
   genomes are correctly reverse complemented.
6. In the filter matches fields:

   -  Set the minimum match length to 500bp. All but one of the matches
      should disappear. Put it back to 100bp.
   -  Set the maximum match length to 500bp. One match should disappear.
      Put it back to 1000000bp.
   -  Set the minimumum percent identity to 99. All but two matches
      should disappear. Put it back to 90.

7. Test saving/loading temporary views work. Press ``shift-1`` to save
   the current view in slot 1. Then move anywhere else and press ``1``.
   It should return to the saved view.
8. Check that searching works. Click on the magnifying glass icon on the
   left, near the bottom. Check the searches below. Clicking on each
   search result at the bottom left should highlight where it is in the
   genome.

   -  Search for the sequence AGTCCAGAGTGGGGG. There should be two
      matches.
   -  Search for ‚Äúname‚Äù in the annotation. There should be several
      matches.

9. Return to the main menu (top left return button or press ``q``), and
   then check that the project can be saved to a file and then loaded
   from that file.

If your code changes affect something not listed above, then obviously
check the releveant functionality. Once you have made the changes and
are happy everything works, submit a pull request. The GitHub
documentation may help if this is your first pull request:
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-open-source.

Improving The Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please raise a GitHub issue for suggestions, or pull requests with fixes
are welcome!

If you want to edit the documentation:

-  The documentation is in the folder ``docs/``.
-  Build a local copy of the documentation by running
   ``sphinx-build -b html -d _build/doctrees . OUT/html``. This assumes
   that sphinx is installed (on Ubuntu the package is python3-sphinx),
   and also the python package sphinx_rtd_theme (which is pip
   installable).
-  Submit a pull request with the changes
