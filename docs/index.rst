Ziplign documentation
=====================

Ziplign is a free application to visualise the comparison of two bacterial genomes.
It is intended to be easy to use: you just need to drag and drop two sequence
files to compare.
Ziplign will run BLAST for you and show you the results. There is no need to use a
terminal or type any commands.

The source code is in the  `Ziplign GitHub repository <https://github.com/martinghunt/ziplign>`_,
under the permissive MIT license. Please report any issues on GitHub.
